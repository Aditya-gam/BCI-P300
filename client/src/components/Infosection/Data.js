    "A Brain-computer Interface (BCI) can be used as a neurofeedback training tool to improve cognitive performance. Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems were developed so that people can control computers or machines through their brain activity without moving their limbs. BCIs aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the conventional neurofeedback methods by focusing on the self-regulation of individualized neuro markers rather than generic ones in a graphically appealing training environment. A P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) is a paradigm, where text characters are decoded from event-related potentials (ERPs).",
